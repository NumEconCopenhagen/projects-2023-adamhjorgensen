# Model analysis project

My project is titled **Ramsey model with endogenous labor supply and a government** and is about households choosing consumption and labor supply rationally when also accounting for taxes.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Ramsey.ipynb](Ramsey.ipynb), which utilizes the classes and functions in RamseyModel.py. 

The project builds on the code from lecture 04_Ramsey. I have andogenized labor supply and added a government, corrected the notation and made different shocks.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
